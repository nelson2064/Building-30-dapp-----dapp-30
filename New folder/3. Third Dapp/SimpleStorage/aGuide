npm install -g truffle

// 0.truffle init
// 1. code smart contract 


// 2. write test code for your smart contract
                   // 1.we got contract artificats
                   // 2.define contract blocks
                   // 3. we define  test 
                   // 4.we got contract instance 
                   // 5.execute the function that we are testing         //we store the result in result variable
                   // 6.after that we do our assertion if this assertion passes our test pass  other wise our test gonaa fail
                   // 7. truffle test

      
// 3.migrations >> wha is migration it is basically means you are chnaging the blockchain state blockchain is none state you changing or you migrating   so blockchain is one state you migrating in another state so when you create smart contract on the blockchain you are migrating you are creating a new transaction you are changing the blockcahin state 



// 4.frontend
// > tuffle compile => contract artifact => abi/address


// 5. now for the contract address we need to start truffle console and deploy the smart contract to the blockchain 
      /// a)start truffle console > truffle develop
      // b)deploy the smart contract migrate --reset 

// 7.after frontend 
// npm i -g static-server
// npm start
